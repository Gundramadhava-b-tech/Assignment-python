INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
Def: Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language
IDLE
* Integrated Development Learning Environment.
* Graphical user interface written in python
* Bundled with default implementation of the python language.
Features of IDLE
* Multi-window text editor with syntax highlighting
* Auto completion with smart indentation
To create a python file Filename.py
Values:
* Value can be any letter, number or string
Examples: 2, 2.5, 'Hello world'
Variables:
* Named place in the memory in which the values can be stored and can be retrieved for later use.
* Name of the variable is user-defined
* Values of Variables can be changed.
Example. x = 12.2
x 12.2 100
y = 14
x = 10
y 14
Features of python
* easy-to-learn
* High-level language
* easy-to-maintain
* Scalable.
* Portable
* interface to database
* extensible
* GUI Programming.
* Free and open Source.
Modes of python Interpreter
Interactive Mode
Interpreter displays the result immediately.
Python 2.7.1 Shell
>>> 5+2
7
>>> print ("Hello world")
Hello world
* commands and expressions are directly executed at prompt
* Cant Save and edit the code
* can see the results immediately
Script Mode
Type the program in a file with (.py) extension and then use interpreter to execute.
Python 2-1-1.Shel
>>> edit sample.PY
Sample.py
*Read and execute statement in a script
* Can Save and edit the code
* cannot see the results immediately,
area.py
x = 10
area = 7*7*3.14
print(area)
To execute

Python 2.7.1 Shell

Input Statements: -> inbuilt function to read the input from user
Addition of 2 numbers
a = int(input ("Enter the first Value"))
b = int(input ("Enter the second Value"))
c = a + b
print(c)
Olp
Enter the first value 2
Enter the second value 3
5
* input function reads the input as string value by default. Explicit conversion is required to read as int
Reserved words:
*Reserved words / Keywords cannot be used as Variable names /identifiers.
and, del, for, is, raise, assent, alif, fum, lamda, return, break, else, global, not, try class, if, while, for, def, print, import..
Ident fiers:
* Names that identify the elements such as Variables and functions in a program.
* ... a sequence of characters that consists of letters, digits and underscores (_)
* ... must start with a letter or an underscore.
* ... cannot start with a digit.
* ... cannot be a keyword.
* ... can be of any length.
Assignment Statements:
* The statement for assigning a value to a variable is called an assignment (operator) statement. operater -> Equal sign =
Syntax: Variable = expression.
* multiple names can be assigned at same time & chained. Ex:x, y = 2,3
>>>> a = b = x = 2
